# How does danscript work?

*1.* when you code in danscript you are talking right to your memory.
when you use danscript you are using bytes(8bits).
-----------------------
*2.* when setting in binary in to a byte remeber to use + = 1/- = 0.  
to code in a byte write `[ ]` and inside those brackets write binary. 
you should be able to create any but only one ASCII character.
---------------------------
*3.* now when you finished your byte you need to add a `>` after, that's because of 
when you have that symbol you saying to start another byte. if you finished you code
fully you dont need to add after something else.
